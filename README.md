# MissionMissile

## Purpose

  Purpose of the Mission Missile is you are a rocket that spawn somewhere in the current map and trying to fly through the landing pad without touching anything harmable.
  There are bunch of obstacles as walls, moving walls, falling blocks and more but there are some other stuff that you need to collect to go further in game like stars 
  and fuels. Stars helps you to get achievements on each level and fuels helps you to keep thrusting through the level. As you can figure rocket's fuel is not enough 
  for landing on the success landing pad unless you collect the fuels.
  
## Keys

- `W` or `space` Activate the thruster. (go up)
- `A` , `D` Rotate the Rocket.
- `R` Restart level.
- `L` Jump to the next level (cheat)
- `C` Harmable obstacles won't be able to harm you anymore (you can take it back if you press it again) (some kind a god mode) (cheat)
